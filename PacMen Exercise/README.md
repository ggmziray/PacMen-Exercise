# Pacmen
Factory game for making pacmen.
Start by pressing the "Add PacMan" button to get at least one pacman positioned and viewable.
After it is pressed you have 1 pacman pushed out from the factory and you can add more before starting the game. 
The other option is pressing "Start Game" to have the position of each new pacman when added to the "game" be in movement. You could add as many pacmen as you want and when added to the array of pacmen, you can keep track of the position and velocity of each pacman, seeing each pacman bouncing off any wall it hits. 

Have a look at the html code to modify it.
